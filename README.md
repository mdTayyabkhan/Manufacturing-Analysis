# 📊 Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard

## 🧩 Project Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the manufacturing process, focusing on production efficiency, rejection rates, and resource utilization. The insights were derived from real production data to identify trends, track output quality, and evaluate machine-employee performance in driving operational efficiency.


## 🎯 Objectives

* To monitor the total **manufactured quantity vs rejected quantity** for accurate wastage analysis.
* To evaluate **employee and machine utilization** in production.
* To track **production trends and department-wise performance** over time.
* To help management make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and reduce losses.


## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and calculations.
* **SQL** – Querying and aggregating production data for accurate KPIs.
* **Power BI** – Dashboard creation, visualization, and insight generation.


## 🔍 Key Insights

* The **overall wastage rate** was approximately **0.61%**, indicating efficient production quality.
* Identified **daily and monthly production trends**, helping to detect performance fluctuations.
* A combined **machine/employee utilization KPI** shows clear visibility into workforce and asset balance.
* Highlighted top-performing and underperforming units for targeted improvement.
* Data-driven KPIs like **Produced Quantity**, **Rejected Quantity**, and **Wastage %** enabled precise monitoring of manufacturing efficiency.
